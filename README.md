## App1
This repository contains the source code for App1, a web application built using JavaScript. App1 consists of multiple components, including app.js, datacome.js, and extra.js.

## Components
app.js
The app.js file serves as the main component of the App1 application. It orchestrates the rendering and functionality of the entire application. It may contain code for managing the state, handling user interactions, and rendering other components.

## Datacome.js
The datacome.js component is responsible for displaying information such as followers, views, and likes. This information is retrieved from a data.json file, which is imported into the datacome.js file. The component is designed to receive the data and present it in a visually appealing way.
## Data.json
```[
    {
        "icon1": "AiOutlineStar",
        "number1": 125
    },
    {
        "icon2":"AiOutlineLike",
        "number2": 134
    },
    {
        "icon3":"AiOutlineEye",
        "number3": 12
    },
    {
        "icon4":"AiOutlineHeart",
        "number4": 129
    }
]
```

## Extra.js
The extra.js component is an additional component included in the App1 application. Its purpose and functionality are not explicitly specified in this README file. Please refer to the source code or relevant documentation for more detailed information about this component.
